# Rival Core
> For AstiaMC

## About
RivalCore is a simple plugin for controlling certain events in Minecraft servers using the `Spigot 1.8.8-API`. As the project originally is not open-source and the `.jar` was obfuscated, we had to think differently. We though obstacles are ment to be conquered. So that is why our great developer `Strokkur24` went out and decompiled the `RivalCore2.jar` anyways and manually reformatted and de-obfuscated it to a useable point. Obviously there are still a few variables we are not sure what they are for but they will be figured out with time.

**Today** the project is being used to customise *RivalCore* further to meet our needs.

## Dependencies
Just like the original RivalCore2, `RivalCore3` requires [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) to work properly. To reduce bugs this plugin should be used on a `Spigot 1.8.8` server as that is its native version.
